            <h3 class= "headings">Neuroplasticity</h3> 
            <p class= "paragraphs">When discussing the concept of neuroplasticity it allows you to think about your learning capability in a much different way that you’ve likely not been exposed to before.</p> 
            <p class= "paragraphs">In contrast to the rigid way that you’re only praised for success in traditional schooling, neuroplasticity promotes the idea that your brain and intelligence is much more malleable than you think and that effort should be praised just as highly as success.</p>
            <p class= "paragraphs">Research has shown that even the discussion of neuroplasticity with school children improves their ability to learn and understand. Giving them the idea that their intelligence is not fixed and is ever changing is very beneficial.</p>
            <p class= "paragraphs">I’ve always found that unless I can fully understand how something works from start to finish, it makes it a lot harder to grasp. Like driving a manual car for instance - someone can show me the different steps needed but because I don’t understand how the mechanisms are operating, it’s never quite sunk in for me. I think this also applies to the brain - once we can really understand what it’s doing and how it’s trying to do it, we can access much more of its power.</p>

            <h3 class= "headings">Engaging with Neuroplasticity</h3> 
            <p class= "paragraphs">To benefit from the principles of neuroplasticity I could definitely engage in more repetition of tasks and concepts more frequently. With Dev Academy for instance I tend to learn pretty well when going through each task but I rarely have the time or motivation to go back and revise. There is so much new information to take on board that it can be overwhelming.</p>
            <p class= "paragraphs">The phrase “Practice makes permanent” stands out to me. It’s a simple concept but not so easy to put into practice. If I can stick to a schedule of revisiting learned concepts in a variety of ways it will increase my neuroplasticity.</p>

            <h3 class= "headings">Increasing Neuroplasticity</h3>
            <p class= "paragraphs">Procrastination is a huge hindrance to neuroplasticity. Understanding what it really is and how to actively push it away will be important for my growth.</p>
            <p class= "paragraphs">The food you eat has a direct affect on your brain and your ability to take in and retain information. Omega 3 & 6, which are fatty acids, can only come from your diet in the form of nuts, seeds and fatty fish. They create and maintain cell membranes which protect cells that transport nutrients into the cell and also transport toxic substances out of the cell. On the other hand, long term consumption of trans and saturated fats such as baked goods and fried food can compromise brain health.</p>
            <p class= "paragraphs">To promote neuroplasticity I need to be more aware of what I’m eating so my brain can be in a healthy state and more accepting of new information.</p>

            <h3 class= "headings">Growth Mindset</h3> 
            <p class= "paragraphs">As opposed to a fixed mindset, a person with a growth mindset is open to challenges and solving problems. Promoting learning as a skill is important, as well as celebrating not just success but effort along the way.</p>
            <p class= "paragraphs">Obstacles are enjoyable and a learning opportunity for those with a growth mindset, they accept that failing is part of learning and will benefit them in the long run.</p>
            <p class= "paragraphs">A growth mindset is important in life if you want to continue your learning journey all throughout adulthood. It will create opportunities and in turn will create a richer, fuller life.</p>

            <h3 class= "headings">Exploration outcome</h3> 
            <p class= "paragraphs">A main theme that I picked up on is that positivity is a crucial role of a growth mindset. If you fall into the easy route of being pessimistic and giving up on trying, your learning will be compromised.</p> 
            <p class= "paragraphs">Failure should not be seen as a soul crushing embarrassment but rather embraced as a chance to learn and develop.</p>

            <h3 class= "headings">Integrating Growth Mindset into my Learning Journey</h3>
            <p class= "paragraphs">When I find myself either stumped by a task or failing over and over I really need to make a conscious effort to see these times as learning opportunities. I need to not feel discouraged or feel that my intelligence is being attacked. I need to see that it’s through these difficult times that my brain is making new pathways and that they will only get stronger through repetition and effort.</p>

          <h3 class= "headings">Influence on my Learning Plan and Strategy</h3> 
          <p class= "paragraphs">I need to keep in mind that my intelligence is not fixed, it can grow and be shaped by my actions and habits. Knowing that failing is okay and should be used as a learning opportunity is also important to acknowledge.</p> 
          <p class= "paragraphs">It may be cliche but staying positive will be crucial for my learning but is also easier said than done. Things like eating well and taking care of myself are a good place to start and will provide a healthy mindset to build on.</p> 
          <p class= "paragraphs">Procrastination is a tough habit to overcome but I'm predicting that really thinking about the negative effects of it on me and my learning journey before I engage in the habits will deter me enough to push through.</p>
