            <h3 class= "headings">Neuroplasticity</h3> 
            <p class= "paragraphs">When discussing the concept of neuroplasticity it allows you to think about your learning capability in a much different way that you’ve likely not been exposed to before.</p> 
            <p class= "paragraphs">In contrast to the rigid way that you’re only praised for success in traditional schooling, neuroplasticity promotes the idea that your brain and intelligence is much more malleable than you think and that effort should be praised just as highly as success.</p>
            <p class= "paragraphs">Research has shown that even the discussion of neuroplasticity with school children improves their ability to learn and understand. Giving them the idea that their intelligence is not fixed and is ever changing is very beneficial.</p>
            <p class= "paragraphs">I’ve always found that unless I can fully understand how something works from start to finish, it makes it a lot harder to grasp. Like driving a manual car for instance - someone can show me the different steps needed but because I don’t understand how the mechanisms are operating, it’s never quite sunk in for me. I think this also applies to the brain - once we can really understand what it’s doing and how it’s trying to do it, we can access much more of its power.</p>

            <h3 class= "headings">Engaging with Neuroplasticity</h3> 
            <p class= "paragraphs">To benefit from the principles of neuroplasticity I could definitely engage in more repetition of tasks and concepts more frequently. With Dev Academy for instance I tend to learn pretty well when going through each task but I rarely have the time or motivation to go back and revise. There is so much new information to take on board that it can be overwhelming.</p>
            <p class= "paragraphs">The phrase “Practice makes permanent” stands out to me. It’s a simple concept but not so easy to put into practice. If I can stick to a schedule of revisiting learned concepts in a variety of ways it will increase my neuroplasticity.</p>

            <h3 class= "headings">Increasing Neuroplasticity</h3>
            <p class= "paragraphs">Procrastination is a huge hindrance to neuroplasticity. Understanding what it really is and how to actively push it away will be important for my growth.</p>
            <p class= "paragraphs">The food you eat has a direct affect on your brain and your ability to take in and retain information. Omega 3 & 6, which are fatty acids, can only come from your diet in the form of nuts, seeds and fatty fish. They create and maintain cell membranes which protect cells that transport nutrients into the cell and also transport toxic substances out of the cell. On the other hand, long term consumption of trans and saturated fats such as baked goods and fried food can compromise brain health.</p>
            <p class= "paragraphs">To promote neuroplasticity I need to be more aware of what I’m eating so my brain can be in a healthy state and more accepting of new information.</p>
