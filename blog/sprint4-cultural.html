            <h3 class= "headings">Emotional Intelligence</h3> 
            <p class= "paragraphs">Emotional Intelligence is the ability to recongnise your emotions in yourself and others and use this information for improved communication and decision making. EQ helps you understand what and why you are feeling the way you are and how to react to it.</p> 
            <p class= "paragraphs">Your EQ is based on many factors including your upbringing, your education and your environment. Empathy is an important attribute to have and develop in relation to your EQ. Being able to see things from others perspective is very beneficial in socialising, in particular two way communication.</p>
            <p class= "paragraphs">I came across this word that I think sums up the basis of EQ, coined by John Koenig in 2012 through his project “The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows” with the aim of defining new words for emotions that currently lack words:</p>
            <p class= "paragraphs">“<strong><em>Sonder</em></strong>: The profound feeling of realizing that everyone, including strangers passed in the street, has a life as complex as one's own, which they are constantly living despite one's personal lack of awareness of it.”</p>

            <h3 class= "headings">IQ VS EQ</h3> 
            <p class= "paragraphs">Your IQ is based on a set of tests that measure your intellectual ability. Schooling focusses on your IQ as a mark of progression and success. EQ on the other hand is not taught in schools although it is developed during this time, we are just less aware of it.</p>

            <h3 class= "headings">The Importance of EQ</h3>
            <p class= "paragraphs">You are confronted with your EQ constantly - In the workplace when dealing with a disgruntled colleague, at home in your personal relationships and possibly even in the supermarket line with an angry customer.</p>
            <p class= "paragraphs">There are studies that show success is heavily influenced by your EQ and the way you can interact with others with empathy and influence. To keep developing as a human it is important to be conscious of your EQ, it never stops growing.</p>
