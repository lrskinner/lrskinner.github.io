            <h3>My Core Personal Values</h3> 
            <p class= "paragraphs">Self reliance is very important to me. Almost four years ago I moved from my hometown of Palmerston North, New Zealand to Melbourne, Australia. My desire to learn and see new things took me over the pond and I learned a lot while I was there about myself. I recognised how important independence is to me and how much I value time on my own. 
                I was able to really explore and support a core value of mine of equality in Melbourne through attending Invasion day and Black Lives Matter rallies. It’s important to recognise your privileges in life and empathise with and actively support those who are discriminated against for their lack of privileges. 
                The Black Lives Matter protest was in July 2020, during the covid pandemic. I was battling with my values and the disapproval of the public and my co-workers. It was a hard decision to make but I went with my gut and attended the protest. Everyone at the protest was prepared with hand sanitiser and masks so in the end no outbreaks were caused by the protest. After the protest my colleagues did express their disappointment in me but I would have felt a lot worse just standing by, not supporting the cause and would have compromised my values. 
                My empathy also extends to animals which was demonstrated by my time spent volunteering at an animal shelter, taking care of marginalised cats who were strays, forgotten or abandoned. It’s my view that animals and insects have just as much right as us humans to be on earth and should be treated as such. During lockdown in Melbourne I was also able to foster cats that were in need of medical care or waiting for a forever home. I was able to put the needs of these animals ahead of my own but also found that they improved my mental health while living on my own and working from home.
                Mental well-being is really important to me although it hasn’t always been. For as long as I remember I have always felt anxious and out of place around people, namely those I don’t know or in large groups. It took me well into my twenties to work out that this was having an effect on my mental health and to notice my general anxieties and low moods. Admitting something wasn’t quite right and seeking help was a really hard thing to do but I’m in a much better place for it and can now recognise and understand my emotions and actions a lot better. In my last workplace I volunteered to undergo Mental Health First Aid training which was a new concept for the company. My empathy and understanding was a great asset for this course and I also gained a lot of knowledge about mental health and how to approach those who you recognise might need help from a professional. 
                Being NZ European gives me a lot of privileges. People are discriminated against for things that are out of their control and these discriminatory actions are systemic. When I realised how unfair the world is and what people are going through through any form of inequality, it really emphasized the importance of empathy and understanding in my life. Women are still marginialised in society and very much so in the workplace. Being part of this demographic and seeing the effects of the inequality only push me more to strive towards my goals and support others in the same boat. 
                Mental health in my culture was a taboo topic in the past and it really has come a long way. This shift really emphasised to me the importance of talking to someone you trust about how you’re feeling and knowing that you can ask for help and won’t be judged for it.</p>

            <h2 class= "intro title">My Strengths and Limitations</h2>

            <p class= "paragraphs">After completing a personality test I found that I am an intuitive introvert who tends to think more with my heart than my head. I found that I was an empathizer who has a personalized approach to people and insists people are treated fairly and feel included. I have a curiosity to learn and take responsibility in my actions. 

                I find reflection a challenge as I rarely look back on my life and am always moving forward. I have low confidence in my abilities which has been a hindrance to my development in the past.  
                
                I grew up in the country in a small family, as the youngest sibling, with very few neighbours. I think my upbringing has influenced my introversion in a big way as crowds and large groups of people are not environments where I thrive. It has made me a private person who can spend time by myself but also feel quite content doing so. As a child I had free reign to discover and learn, helping me develop my curiosity and carry it on throughout my adulthood.
                
                When I was new to the workforce and working in a front desk role I had a colleague who did not gel with me from the start. There would be tasks that we would take turns doing in the team and if I asked her to do them, she wouldn’t complete them. As I was barely in my twenties I didn’t have much experience with these types of situations. My strategy at the time was to be civil and only communicate for work purposes. I didn’t notify my boss of this struggle as I was a temporary employee and thought that complaining would make me look bad in the eyes of my employer. These strategies did not work for me as it was affecting my mental health by causing stress and anxiety. It got to a point where I wouldn’t want to go to work. 
                
                If I come across a situation like this in the future I would have the experience and confidence to know that I can seek help from my employer in situations like this for mediation and resolution. I would also employ more empathy to try to understand where the other person is coming from, see things from their point of view and understand their actions better.
                
                My curiosity will be an asset in my learning journey as it will help me engage with tasks by wanting to know how things work and how to solve problems. My empathy for others will help when communicating with my cohort. I find it easy to put myself in other people's shoes and understand where they’re coming from. 
                
                I can see my introversion and low confidence in my abilities being a limitation when it comes to my career. It will be more of a challenge in job interviews to sell myself to a potential employer. My empathy will also be an asset in the workplace when it comes to collaborating and potential conflicts that may arise. My ability to take responsibility for my own actions is important in a workplace. As humans we inevitably make mistakes and not admitting to them will only create more issues and frustration for others.
