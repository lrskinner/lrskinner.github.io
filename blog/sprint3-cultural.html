            <hr class="hr">

            <h3 class= "headings">Long term goal</h3> 
            <p class= "paragraphs">My long term goal is to become a software developer. I’m not yet sure which area I want to pursue but am expecting to figure that out along the way. First by starting as a junior and continuing to learn in a workplace environment.</p> 
        </span>
        <span>
            <h3 class= "headings">Human skills to be developed at EDA</h3> 
            <p class= "paragraphs">I hope to improve my time management and communication skills while working in a team at EDA. Having to use timeboxing to track time has been a good exercise for me as I'm not great with taking notice of the time or how long I’ve spent on a task. I still find it hard to stick to the recommended times for tasks so I will need to keep working on that.</p>
            <p class= "paragraphs">I’m not always comfortable around new people and can become introverted and avoid interaction. I’m hoping to tackle this and put myself out there more in team situations.</p>
        </span>
        <span>
            <h3 class= "headings">My strengths and limitations</h3>
            <p class= "paragraphs">After completing a personality test I found that I am an intuitive introvert who tends to think more with my heart than my head. I found that I was an empathizer who has a personalized approach to people and insists people are treated fairly and feel included. I have a curiosity to learn and take responsibility in my actions.</p>
            <p class= "paragraphs">I find reflection a challenge as I rarely look back on my life and am always moving forward. I have low confidence in my abilities which has been a hindrance to my development in the past.</p>
            <p class= "paragraphs">I grew up in the country in a small family, as the youngest sibling, with very few neighbours. I think my upbringing has influenced my introversion in a big way as crowds and large groups of people are not environments where I thrive. It has made me a private person who can spend time by myself but also feel quite content doing so. As a child I had free reign to discover and learn, helping me develop my curiosity and carry it on throughout my adulthood.</p>
            <p class= "paragraphs">My curiosity will be an asset in my learning journey as it will help me engage with tasks by wanting to know how things work and how to solve problems. My empathy for others will help when communicating with my cohort. I find it easy to put myself in other people's shoes and understand where they’re coming from.</p>
            <p class= "paragraphs">I can see my introversion and low confidence in my abilities being a limitation when it comes to my career. It will be more of a challenge in job interviews to sell myself to a potential employer. My empathy will also be an asset in the workplace when it comes to collaborating and potential conflicts that may arise. My ability to take responsibility for my own actions is important in a workplace. As humans we inevitably make mistakes and not admitting to them will only create more issues and frustration for others.</p>

            <h3 class= "headings">A commitment to managing my workload</h3> 
            <p class= "paragraphs">To effectively manage my workload in this programme I will set myself realistic and achievable timeboxes for completing tasks and stick to the times I have set. I will make time to reflect on my day at the end of each day to ensure I am taking in information and making sense of it.</p>
            <p class= "paragraphs">To work effectively in a team I will avoid being introverted and will participate in group tasks with empathy and openness. I will communicate with my cohort, facilitators and industry/community representatives in a respectful and professional manner.</p>
        </span>
            
        <span>
            <h3 class= "headings">A commitment to seeking help</h3> 
            <p class= "paragraphs">When I need help I will reach out to my cohort or a facilitator. I will try to solve my issue first but if I am spending too much time on it and getting nowhere i will seek help. This is to avoid getting to a breaking point and getting too discouraged.</p>
        </span>
           
        <span>
            <h3 class= "headings">What I expect from the facilitation team</h3> 
            <p class= "paragraphs">I see the facilitation team as my guides along this journey who I can rely on. They are there to provide constructive feedback and keep me on track. I would expect the facilitators to respond to messages in a timely manner and that we respect each others time.</p>
        </span>
     
        <span>
            <h3 class= "headings">Scheduling information</h3> 
            <p class= "paragraphs">I don’t have any solid commitments but I do think it’s important to have down time after about 7pm on working days. I don’t want to burn out or become too overwhelmed so I need to make sure to dedicate time to unwind and socialise to keep myself sane.</p>
