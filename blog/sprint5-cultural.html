            <h3 class= "headings">Things I’ve learned about myself</h3> 
            <p class= "paragraphs">I’ve learned that I can be really hard on myself when I feel like I’m failing or not up to speed and that it’s really hard to get out of that mindset. I realised that I'm pretty in tune with my emotions and empathy and how that is an asset in the tech industry. When I push myself I can be quite social and put myself out there, but that is admittedly easier online!</p>

            <h3 class= "headings">The Roles of Values, Empathy and Self Awareness in Learning and Programming</h3> 
            <p class= "paragraphs">Programming isn’t always an individual activity, pair programming and team work is an important part of if too. To work well in a team it helps to really know who you are and how you react in situations, to be the best team player you can be.</p>
            <p class= "paragraphs">Empathy is really important - that is, having empathy for yourself and for others. When learning, being hard on yourself won’t get you anywhere and only leaves you feeling bad about yourself and your abilities. Having empathy for others when working in a team is vital. Being able to put yourself in others’ shoes can avoid clashes and arguments and create a great working environment for everyone.</p>
            <p class= "paragraphs">Self-awareness is “the ability to accurately recognize one's own emotions, thoughts, and values, and how they influence behavior”. Being self aware helps when learning as the more you know about yourself and the better you can recognise your emotions, the easier it is to know how you react in stressful situations and how to avoid them. </p>

            <h3 class= "headings">Core Learning Surprises and Challenges</h3>
            <p class= "paragraphs">It pleasantly surprised me that EQ is so highly regarded by employers in the tech industry. In my personal experience, I have encountered many co-workers with less than desirable EQ’s. Knowing that this is an asset and more highly regarded than technical skills in some cases is really encouraging for the future. </p>
            <p class= "paragraphs">I found it really difficult to explore my core values and identity. They are influenced by my upbringing and experiences, but it’s rare for me to take time to think about my identity and what really matters to me. It helped me understand myself better and recognise why I react to things in certain ways.</p>

            <h3 class= "headings">Why are Core Skills taught at EDA?</h3> 
            <p class= "paragraphs">I think the main reason is to emphasise to people how their actions and emotions affect others. While learning the technical skills are important, it needs to be paired with EQ. Whether in the workplace or in your personal life, being respectful and professional with others is a huge asset and can help you be more employable and successful. </p>

            <h3 class= "headings">Why Learning Core Skills is Important</h3> 
            <p class= "paragraphs">I really appreciated the core teachings throughout the course. It helped me explore who I am in a structured way. Just as importantly I think it was a good and needed break from the technical aspects of the course. I can see the course being really overwhelming if it only focused on the technical skills.</p>
            <p class= "paragraphs">Learning core skills will also help me be more employable once the course is over. Having the technical skills is great but that alone isn’t enough for employers, a balance of these skills will put me in a great position for the future and allow me to have the confidence for a career in the tech industry.</p>
