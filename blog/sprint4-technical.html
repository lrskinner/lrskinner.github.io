      <h3 class= "headings">Working Through a Problem</h3>
        <p class= "paragraphs">A problem that I couldn’t figure out for a while was in the kata test environment. I was under the impression that each variable needed to be set in order for the code to work.</p>
        <p class= "paragraphs">For instance in the Built-in Methods kata with the concat function, I was trying to set the arrays as variables and refer back to those specific variables to pass the tests. This worked for the first string, but when I tried to set a new variable with a new string, the function kept referring to the first function, and vice versa with the second function.</p>
        <p class= "paragraphs">It took looking at the sample answer and working backwards to work out how the code was working. I also sought help from my facilitator who explained that the function page where I was writing the code was linking to another page to extract the arrays and strings for the tests.</p>
        <p class= "paragraphs">In retrospect I can see that of course this was what the test environment was doing, but this wasn’t obvious to me in a stressed state. I’ve noticed that learning becomes a lot harder when stressed.</p>
        <p class= "paragraphs">My brain tends to effectively shut down in self preservation so this makes it very difficult to absorb and retain information. I need to avoid getting to that state in the first place by not getting immediately overwhelmed by tasks and breaking them down into smaller problems to tackle.</p>

      <h3 class= "headings">Solving a Problem in a More Elegant Way</h3>
        <p class= "paragraphs">Javascript is totally new to me so I’m still getting to grips with the long winded descriptive code. A challenge for me has been converting descriptive code to succinct code. In saying that I have been researching methods of how to shorten code that still performs a useful function.</p>
        <p class= "paragraphs">The arrow function ‘=>’ looks like it would be a very effective way of saving time and space with code. With a traditional function you would name the function, specify the argument, then state how you want the function to perform.</p>
        <p class= "paragraphs">The arrow function erases the need for the function syntax and even the return operation as it is implied. You can then remove the curly brackets and any remaining parentheses around the argument.</p>
        <p class= "paragraphs">With this you’ve gone from a convoluted two line code to a succinct one line code. Admittedly it takes longer to decipher the code in a format like this, but I hope to get to the level where I can implement the arrow function effectively. I was pleasantly surprised with myself that after feeling like I was not up to the kata tasks and failing many times, I was still interested in learning ways to improve my code. This gives me hope for the times where I’m feeling particularly bad about my skills and abilities that I can push through it and continue to want to learn.</p>

      <h3 class= "headings">Problem Solving Methods</h3>
        <p class= "paragraphs">Using pseudocode is just as foreign to me as using Javascript but I can see the benefits of writing the code as simple steps initially then fleshing it out as code, so I am trying to incorporate it into my problem solving.</p>
        <p class= "paragraphs">Trial and error seems to be my go to problem solving method. I have found it to be an effective method with a few issues I have had, by trying out a solution I thought might work, that failing, altering the code slightly and looping through that a few times.</p>
        <p class= "paragraphs">The rubber ducky method is one I haven’t tried yet. I’m not much of a talker, even when I’m by myself, so it doesn’t come naturally to me to talk through a problem out loud to an inanimate object.</p>
        <p class= "paragraphs">I have found reading error messages to be pretty helpful when I’m stuck on a problem, especially when it’s a syntax issue that I didn’t pick up on.</p>
        <p class= "paragraphs">I haven’t got to grips with console logging, but like with pseudocode I can definitely see the benefits and want to incorporate it in my problem solving. By using the console.log() function in your html, navigating to inspect, then console, you can use this as a pretty effective debugging tool.</p>
        <p class= "paragraphs">When I have a problem I definitely go straight to google for help. Any issue I could have has been encountered before, asked about on the internet and most likely answered. It’s also the least intrusive way of seeking help.</p>
        <p class= "paragraphs">I’m pretty comfortable with asking peers for help, either through the foundations channel on Slack or messaging someone from my cohort that I’ve done a looping exercise with. I do get self conscious with my questions, especially if I think others will see them as being very basic.</p>
        <p class= "paragraphs">At times like these I am more comfortable asking my facilitator for help as I know I won’t get any judgement. I try to go through all of my other problem solving techniques though before I reach out to my peers or facilitator so I can attempt to solve it first on my own.</p>
        <p class= "paragraphs">I am still really bad at reflecting on my days even though I know the proven benefits of it when learning. It’s a hard habit to form for me, especially if I’ve had a tough day with the curriculum, the last thing I want to do is go back over the stressful parts. I’m going to make a conscious effort of reflecting back over the things I have learned with revision but I think doing this weekly rather than daily is more realistic for me.</p>
